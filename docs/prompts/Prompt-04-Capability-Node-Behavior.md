# Prompt 04 — Capability Node Behavior

Capability nodes represent what the enterprise can do and remain stable over time.

## Rules

- Capabilities exist independently of organizational structure.
- Capabilities must never appear under Enterprise nodes in the Explorer.
- Relationships between Enterprise and Capability are represented only via explicit links (e.g., HAS_CAPABILITY).

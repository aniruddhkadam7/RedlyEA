# Prompt 11 — Governance Explorer Rules

Governance sections (Principles, Requirements, Standards) are constraints, not structure.

## Rules

- Governance items must not appear embedded inside Business/Application/Technology trees.
- Governance items apply via relationships and validation, not containment.

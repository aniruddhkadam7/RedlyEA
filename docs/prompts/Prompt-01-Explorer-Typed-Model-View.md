# Prompt 01 — Explorer is a Typed Model View (Foundational Rule)

Treat the Explorer as a typed projection of the EA metamodel, not a file tree.

## Rules

- Each Explorer section maps 1:1 to a metamodel concept (Enterprise, Capability, Application, Technology, etc.).
- Never infer or auto-create elements across types.
- UI hierarchy must not imply semantic ownership unless defined in the metamodel.

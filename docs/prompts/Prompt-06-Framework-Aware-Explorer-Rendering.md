# Prompt 06 — Framework-Aware Explorer Rendering

Explorer rendering must adapt to the selected framework (e.g., ArchiMate, Custom, Ultimate).

## Rules

- Framework selection controls which node types are visible.
- Framework selection controls which sections are enabled.
- Framework selection controls which element types can be created.
- Framework changes must never mutate existing model data.

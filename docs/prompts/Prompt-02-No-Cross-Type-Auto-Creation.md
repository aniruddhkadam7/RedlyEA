# Prompt 02 — No Cross-Type Auto-Creation (Critical)

Creating an element of one type must NEVER auto-create an element of another type.

## Rules

- No cross-type auto-creation (e.g., creating a Capability must not create an Enterprise).
- All cross-type relationships must be explicit, user-driven, and visible as relationships (not implied by hierarchy).

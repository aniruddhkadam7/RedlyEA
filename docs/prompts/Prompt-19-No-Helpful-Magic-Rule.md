# Prompt 19 — No “Helpful Magic” Rule

Senior-architect tooling must remain explicit. No convenience automation.

## Rules

- Do not auto-create elements, views, or relationships.
- Do not auto-link elements.
- Do not auto-group elements.
- Do not auto-name elements.
- All creation and linking must be explicit, user-driven actions.
